# MFES

Jyve empowers local musicians and bands by connecting them to venues through a mobile app.
Through the app you'll be able to create a profile, connect with musicians, sync your calendar, find
gigs and manage them all in one place. At Jyve we strive to solve the common problems in the local
music scene by creating the one stop app for musicians, bands, and venues.
